# Exploratory analysis of emissions in the US
This is a full exploratory analysis of from the [EPA National Emissions Inventory web site](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories).
The dataset used for this analysis can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip).

In this repository you will find each piece of code for each plot, to make it easy for everyone who wants to try it plot by plot. In case you want to plot them all at once, it is easy to merge.

We are going to answer some really interesting questions to have an idea of how our data about emissions looks like.
