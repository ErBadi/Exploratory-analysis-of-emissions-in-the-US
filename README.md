# Exploratory analysis of emissions in the US
This is a full exploratory analysis of from the [EPA National Emissions Inventory web site](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories).
The dataset used for this analysis can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip).

In this repository you will find each piece of code for each plot, to make it easy for everyone who wants to try it plot by plot. In case you want to plot them all at once, it is easy to merge.

We are going to answer some really interesting questions to have an idea of how our data about emissions looks like.

1. **Have total emissions in the United States from 1999 to 2008?**

Using the base plotting system, I will make a plot showing the total emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.



2. **Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland fips == "24510" from 1999 to 2008?**

Using the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.



3. **Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?**

Using the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.



4. **Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?**

Using the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.



5. **How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?**

Using the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.



5. **Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips=="06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?**

Using the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
