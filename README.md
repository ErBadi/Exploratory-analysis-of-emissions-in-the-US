# Exploratory analysis of emissions in the US
This is a full exploratory analysis of from the [EPA National Emissions Inventory web site](https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories).
The dataset used for this analysis can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip).

In this repository you will find each piece of code for each plot, to make it easy for everyone who wants to try it plot by plot. In case you want to plot them all at once, it is easy to merge.

We are going to answer some really interesting questions to have an idea of how our data about emissions looks like.

1. Have total emissions in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
Using the base plotting system, I will make a plot showing the total emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.



2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (\color{red}{\verb|fips == "24510"|}fips=="24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
